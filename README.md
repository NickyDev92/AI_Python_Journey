  Hi, I’m Nicky Rongen — an aspiring AI & Data Developer from the Netherlands.
After years of curiosity about technology and automation, I decided to fully commit to mastering Python, Data Science, and AI Development.

I founded PygenixAI, representing the fusion of creativity and intelligence — where golden ideas flow into the purple world of AI and automation.

This repository documents my 26-week journey — every step, project, and milestone as I grow into a junior-to-mid-level developer.
I’m passionate about learning through building, solving real problems, and crafting clean, production-ready code.
